                My name is Augustus Madden. I am a recent graduate of Drexel University's Westphal College of Media Arts and Design, having earned a Bachelor's degree in Animation and Visual Effects. I've spent most of my life living in the Philadelphia Area. Hobbies include cooking, working out, and listening to educational podcasts in my downtime.

                I'm interested in all aspects of content creation, with a current focus on web design work. I have a strong interest in narrative and interactivity, and I'm looking for an opportunity to join a team of professionals interested in creating meaningful, compelling content.
